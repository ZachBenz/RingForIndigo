# RingForIndigo
Ring plugin for Indigo Home Automation Server from Indigo Domotics

# Recommendaded Ring Account Configuration

It is STRONGLY recommended that you create a secondary account on Ring for Indigo to use. Whether or not you ultimately plan to enable two-factor authentication on the secondary account, be sure to still give that account a complex password that you don't use anywhere else, for maximum security.

# Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication support is experimental.  It has gone through some testing, but if you enable it, please know that you face the risk of being frozen out of your Ring account for 24 hours or more.  Please report any problems you encounter in the Support Forum for this plugin.
